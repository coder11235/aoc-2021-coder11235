parsing:
create a list of scanners
read each scanner data
    for each scanner take all the beacons and parse them to processable format
    create a list of all orientations
    get all orientations possible
    for each orientation that the scanner can be in
        tranforms the processed beacons to that format
        create a list of all the main beacons which the other beacons are relative to
        for each beacon
            take all the other beacons in the scanner and find the relative positons to it in a list
            add them to the list of main beacons
        add them and the negative and rotation function to the list of orientations [[neg, rot], beacons]
    add them to the list of scanners
convert all the data into json and dump it to 'parsed_(data/sample).json'
